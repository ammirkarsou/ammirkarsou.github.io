# Site Portfolio

This repository will host my GitHub Pages site with tabbed navigation so visitors can jump between sections like About, Projects, and Contact. The plan is to keep the content lightweight and fast so it works well on all devices.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Draft the overall layout and color palette
- [ ] Implement the HTML/CSS/JS for the tabbed sections
- [ ] Add initial content for each tab
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for deployment
