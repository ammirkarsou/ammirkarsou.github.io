Thanks for stopping by! I'm Ammir, and this website is dedicated to the seismic imaging solutions I'm developing—from field data QC through high-fidelity subsurface models. I focus on the full seismic value chain: preprocessing noisy gathers, designing scalable imaging algorithms, and pushing inversion workflows that honor rock physics as much as computation.

What I'm working on right now
======
- **Imaging pipelines.** I'm tuning reverse time migration (RTM) and FWI flows that squeeze more structural detail out of challenging azimuthal surveys and complex salt bodies.
- **Processing algorithms.** I'm benchmarking noise attenuation, deghosting, and regularization steps so the processing outputs preserve amplitude fidelity for downstream inversion.

Coming soon
------
- An open Python-based seismic software package that bundles my go-to preprocessing kernels, imaging operators, and inversion recipes into reusable modules.
- A refreshed projects section with long-form case studies covering acquisition design tweaks, processing diagnostics, and imaging breakthroughs on real basins.
- A deeper dive into how I'm mixing physics-informed approaches with modern compute (GPU acceleration, cloud scaling) to keep seismic processing and inversion loops fast and reliable.

I'll keep shipping updates as projects move from whiteboard to production, so feel free to explore the rest of the site and check back often. If you'd like to collaborate or just swap ideas, reach out through the links in the sidebar—I’d love to connect.
